```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# rmdhelp::show_knit_hook_call()
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmdhelp::hook_convert_odg)
```


# Disclaimer
This document contains some instructions on how to run the program 'ewbc'.


# General Running Mode
The program 'ewbc' is a command-line program. It seams to work from the 'Terminal' inside of RStudio (see screenshot).

```{r run-ewbc-terminal, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/run-ewbc-terminal.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/run-ewbc-terminal.png")
```

When you opened a 'Terminal' in RStudio, then you can enter the commands that are shown below. 


# Preparation 
The preparatory steps consist of 

1. creating a directory for the analysis
2. change the current working directory to that newly created directory
3. copy all input-files into the newly created directory
4. running the program 'ewbc' with the given parameters

For any given analysis the steps 1-3 must only be done once. For a new analysis which is sufficiently different from the previous analysis with, e.g. a different production system or a different breed, all four steps must be repeated, but the name of the newly created directory must be different between the current and any previous analyses.


## Creating a new directory
A new directory with the name 'ecoweighttest' is created with the following command that is to be entered at the 'Terminal'. 

```
mkdir ecoweighttest
```


## Change current working directory
The current working directory is changed into the newly created directory with 

```
cd ecoweighttest
```


## Copy input
The input required by 'ewbc' is copied into the newly created directory with the following command

```
cp /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/linuxBin/EWBC_2019_Angus/INPUT*.TXT \
/qualstorzws01/data_projekte/linuxBin/EWBC_2019_Angus/PARA.TXT \
/qualstorzws01/data_projekte/linuxBin/EWBC_2019_Angus/TEXT_OUT.TXT .
```

The dot at the end of the above statement is important.


## Running ewbc
If necessary, the input files must be changed. Once the input is adapted, then the program can be run with the following command 
```
ewbc
```


# Overview
The following screenshot shows how all the commands are entered into the 'Terminal'

```{r run-ewbc-summary, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/run-ewbc-summary.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/run-ewbc-summary.png")
```
